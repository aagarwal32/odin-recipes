                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>There is nothing more satisfying than taking a bite out of a fluffy pancake.
                    But before we start, how do these pancakes get so <strong>fluffy</strong> in the first place?
                    Well, the answer is air! Homemade buttermilk from a mix of milk and sugar and
                    two leaveners create air bubbles in the pancake batter which result in light
                    and fluffy pancakes.

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
                    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                    <li>cooking spray</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol class="ordered list">
                    <li>Combine milk and vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to make sour milk.</li>
                    <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk egg 
                        and butter into soured milk. Pour flour mixture into milk mixture and whisk until lumps are gone.
                    </li>
                    <li>Preheat a spacious skillet on medium heat, and apply a layer of cooking spray. Ladle 1/4 cup of batter
                         onto the skillet, cooking until bubbles appear and the edges become dry, typically taking 2 to 3 minutes. 
                         Use a spatula to flip the pancake, cooking until the other side turns golden brown. Repeat the process with 
                         the remaining batter.
                        </li>
